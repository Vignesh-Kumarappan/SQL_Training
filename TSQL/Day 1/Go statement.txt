GO is not a SQL keyword.It is a batch terminator.

It's a batch separator used by client tools (like SSMS) to break the entire script up into batches.

SQL Server utilities interpret GO as a signal that they should send the current batch of Transact-SQL 
statements to an instance of SQL Server. (i.e).. The GO command groups SQL commands into batches which
are sent to the server together. 

These commands can be used to facilitate the readability and execution of batches and scripts.
